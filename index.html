        <p>Hi! My name is Saumya Gupta and I'm a current first-year student at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism where I'm studying narrative and investigative reporting.</p>
        <p>Before I attended UC Berkeley, I interned at the Southern California News Group where I covered the city of Duarte and did general reporting throughout the San Gabriel Valley. I covered school board meetings, events, city coucil meetings and breaking news.</p>
        <p>During my undergraduate studies, I reported for my student newspaper, the Daily Bruin, where I wrote primarily for the national news and higher education beat. I covered the University of California system, the UC Board of Regents, state politics and national politics. I was also an editor for the same beat during my junior year where I worked with about 20 writers and wrote breaking news stories. </p>
       <p> During my time at UC Berkeley, I plan to refine my skills as a reporter, and learn new skills in invesigative reporting, data journalism, multimedia, audio and photography.</p>
